This is a taxi calling service implemented using graphs. The map of the place is inputted from the user in the form of different stop points and distance between these points.

The software executes the taxi requests in the preference order of their arrival (using a queue). The taxi takes the person from the source to the destination through the shortest path found using the djikstra's algorithm.

The taxi call can also come when the taxi is between two stoppage points and even then it is executed properly.
